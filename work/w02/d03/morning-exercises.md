####Exercises

1. Create an HTML **table** element with several rows and one column. The columns can be different names of fruit, cars..etc.

> Pull the table into your javascript code using a variable named 'myTable'.

> Print to the console the innerHTML of the first child node.

> Set the class of the first child node to 'red'.

2. Create an **input** tag with a name attribute of "myInput", and a value of "1"

> Pull the input into your javascript code using a variable named "myInput"

> Set the value of the input to "4"

> Change the elements name attribute to "newName"

3. Create a **div** tag that has several **p** tag descendants. The **p** tags will all be siblings with a class equal to "p".

> Pull all the <p> tags into a variable named....pTags(yep we're super creative today)..using one of the methods above.

> Now do it with another method.

> Do it again using the DOM Hierarchy.

> Remove the first <p> tag.

> Insert one back in to restore balance to the universe.


4. Challenge point: Without googling and copy and pasting code,can you create a brand new table using javascript only, with the following structure:

```html
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
       <th> Fruit </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>Pear</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
```

You can use google to investigate the *appendChild* DOM method
